    <h1>Blinkenlichten Project</h1>
    <p>An interactive cityscape with Arduino and LEDs</p>
  </header>
  <section>
    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
      The "Blinkenlichten" project was a collaborative effort by a group of four students to create an interactive cityscape using Arduino boards, motion sensors, and LED lights. 
      The overarching theme of the project was "City and Street," with a focus on sustainability by using recycled materials for construction. 
      The project aimed to combine physical crafting with programming to create a visually engaging and interactive experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cityscape consisted of two rows of small houses, each illuminated by LED lights. Motion sensors were used to detect movement, triggering a chain reaction where the houses lit up sequentially as the viewer walked through the "street." 
      The limited color palette of red, blue, and white was chosen to maintain a cohesive and striking visual aesthetic.

    <h2>Electronics</h2>
    <h3>Arduino Board</h3>
    <p>
      The Arduino board served as the central control unit for the project. It was programmed to manage the lighting sequence of the LEDs based on input from the motion sensors. 
      The simplicity and versatility of the Arduino platform made it an ideal choice for this interactive installation.

    <h3>Motion Sensor</h3>
    <p>
      Motion sensors were placed at either end of the street to detect the presence of a viewer. When triggered, the sensors sent signals to the Arduino board, initiating the lighting sequence. 
      This added an interactive element to the project, making the cityscape come alive as viewers moved through it.

    <h3>Wiring</h3>
    <p>
      The wiring process involved connecting the LEDs, motion sensors, and Arduino boards to create a functional circuit. Initially, the setup was a "cable mess," but the team later soldered the connections onto a circuit board for better organization and reliability. 
      This step required precision and patience, as any faulty connection could disrupt the entire system.

    <h2>Construction</h2>
    <h3>Building the Houses</h3>
    <p>
      The houses were constructed using recycled materials such as tea boxes, egg cartons, cans, and plastic packaging. 
      After assembling the basic structures, the houses were spray-painted blue to create a uniform appearance.
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">

    </div>
    <p>
      Small square windows were cut into the houses using a cutter knife. Once the houses were ready, they were arranged into two rows to form a street-like layout. LED light strips were threaded through the houses and connected to the Arduino boards.
